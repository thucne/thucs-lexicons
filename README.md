### This project is to apply JS, TS and React good practices as I am watching the tutorials on Udemy Courses

-   **Status**: under development 🚧 (as I am learning and building)
-   The project is aimed to achieve good practices of using TS/JS and React
-   What to expect (when I'm done)

    -   A small app that allows us to search and add to our browser storage favorite words (not too much words as I'm using a free Supabase plan 🙂)
    -   Applying good practices in both TS/JS and React including proper use of TS types, components splitting (atomic pattern), data fetching/rendering, state management with redux, fetching data with GraphQL (right now I'm using RESTs and SWR for data fetching, just for now!) and more!
    -   SEO friendly with dynamic routes.

-   Keywords: Next.js, TypeScript, MUI, Redux, Advanced DOM manipulation, React Event Listener, React Hooks.
-   ***Special thanks to Free Dictionary API*** 📗, this app cannot be built without a free dictionary API like this!
